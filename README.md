#  SwiftStatusfy

[Statusfy](https://github.com/paulyoung/Statusfy), but rewritten in Swift. Based on the [example](https://github.com/zaferarican/menubarpopoverswiftui2) by [zaferarican](https://github.com/zaferarican). Basically an excuse to make my first Swift project, written in about an hour. But it works!

## Todo

- [ ] Add preferences
    - [ ] Show/hide player state
- [ ] Add application icon
